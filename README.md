# About
This is the very first videogame I did at my first year at university. It was developed with other classmates (Victor Ramos, Eloy Villanueva and Pablo Luengo).
It is a tower defense in which you have to build towers to defend yourself from the attack of several species of birds.
The game was made with GameMaker Studio 1.
